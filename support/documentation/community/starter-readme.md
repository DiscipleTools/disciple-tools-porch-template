# Disciple Tools - Porch Template

__Kick start your Disciple.Tools porch plugin project with this template!__


## Purpose

A team, organization, or movement effort might love Disciple.Tools, but __wish it had one more thing.__

We know that even though we have a common commission to make disciples of all nations, yet our assignments
on how to do that differ greatly or even if we share similar values our stages in movement differ. Either way,
we know we can't create everything everyone needs.

Instead of waiting for us, you can run ahead on your own. This
plugin includes all our best practices and starter codes for the most commonly developed extensions.

A Disciple Tools porch is a plugin that places a micro site in front of a Disciple Tools system. It can be made as a single page
or multi-page site with lead forms, sign up forms, and even a lightweight logged in experience for non-DT users.

A porch can also be used to cloak the presence of the Disciple Tools system, by hiding it behind a benign public page, for security sensitive implementations.
This porch can have direct integration or no integration with the Disciple Tools system running behind it.

__This plugin is for developers__ who want to extend the Disciple.Tools system for their movement effort.
